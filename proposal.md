This team consists of two graduate students and three undergrad students from the University of Nebraska – Omaha.  Each member of the team brings unique technical skills and past experiences, giving the team a diverse background.  A detailed description of each team member can be found below.

* Kerolos Lotfy is an experienced in Cyber Security professional with a demonstrated history of conducting penetration tests and source code reviews. Skilled in application, network, and operating system security risks. Along with technical risk assessments, vulnerability management, and remediation. Kerolos, is also published in the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services titled “Assessing Pairing and Data Exchange Mechanism Security in the Wearable Internet of Things.” Currently finishing up Masters of Science(MS) in Cybersecurity, with an undergraduate degree in Information Assurance with a minor in Computer Science. 

* Alisa Bohac is an undergraduate student at the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO).  She will graduate from UNO in May 2018 with a B.S. in Cybersecurity and a minor in Computer Science.  Throughout her time as an undergrad, she has held technical positions in two industries, namely software and defense contracting.  She interned at a local software company where she worked with the software engineering team on a credit card processing system.  Furthermore, she spent the past summer in Lexington, Massachusetts, as a part MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s cyber division.  While at Lincoln, she created an encrypted communication channel for a DoD system.  Finally, she was a recipient of the Walter Scott, Jr. Scholarship and was a member of the Scott Scholar community throughout college.  Her interests include penetration testing and digital forensics. 

* Dan Ritter is a cybersecurity graduate student at the University of Nebraska Omaha seeking a MS in Cybersecurity, which he is expected to graduate with in May 2018. He graduated with his Bachelors in Cybersecurity with a Computer Science minor in May 2017, after just three years. He is currently President of NULLify, UNO’s cybersecurity club. He was a computer science tutor for one year before becoming a cyber security intern at Gallup. His Gallup role has since transformed into a regular part-time role, and will become a full-time role in June. He is currently working on his OSCP certification. Dan’s interest include pen testing, network security, and concepts related to reverse engineering. 

* Michael Keck is a undergraduate student at the University of Nebraska Omaha studying Cyber Security and Computer Science.  While his professional background is not in Cyber Security or Computer Science, Michael has ten years of military experience with which has contributed to personable skills such as leadership, working in a group to accomplish a common goal, and being a overall badass.  Michael is currently working on learning more about Cyber Security through classes at the university and also on his own time.  His interest is in digital and mobile forensics, industrial control systems, and penetration testing.  Michael is will be graduating fall 2018.
 
* Alexander G. Diaz is a undergraduate student at the University of Omaha at Nebraska and is currently enrolled in the Cyber Security program with an expected graduation date in the Fall of 2018. He is currently working on his Security+ Certification, which should be completed by May 2018. His interest in Cyber Security developed from an desire to harden infrastructure systems against attacks, and is therefore interested in code hardening, digital forensics, and digital industrial systems.
