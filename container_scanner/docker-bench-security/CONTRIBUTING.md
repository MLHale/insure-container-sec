# Contributing to Docker Bench for Security

Want to hack on Docker Bench? Awesome! Here are instructions to get you
started.

The Docker Bench for Security is a part of the [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
project, and follows the same rules and principles. If you're already familiar
with the way Docker does things, you'll feel right at home.

Otherwise, go read
[Docker's contributions guidelines](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development Environment Setup

The only thing you need to hack on Docker Bench for Security is a POSIX 2004
compliant shell. We try to keep the project compliant for maximum portability.

### Start hacking

You can build the container that wraps the docker-bench for security:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
docker build -t docker-bench-security .
```

Or you can simply run the shell script locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh
```

The Docker Bench has the main script called `docker-bench-security.sh`.
This is the main script that checks for all the dependencies, deals with
command line arguments and loads all the tests.

The tests are split into the following files:

```sh
tests/
├── 1_host_configuration.sh
├── 2_docker_daemon_configuration.sh
├── 3_docker_daemon_configuration_files.sh
├── 4_container_images.sh
├── 5_container_runtime.sh
├── 6_docker_security_operations.sh
└── 7_docker_swarm_configuration.sh
```

To modify the Docker Bench for Security you should first clone the repository,
make your changes, check your code with `shellcheck`, `checkbashisms` or similar
tools, and then sign off on your commits. After that feel free to send us a
pull request with the changes.

While this tool was inspired by the [CIS Docker 1.11.0 benchmark](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/show-single/index.cfm?file=docker16.110)
and its successors, feel free to add new tests. We will try to turn
[dockerbench.com](https://dockerbench.com) into a list of good community
benchmarks for both security and performance, and we would love community
contributions.
